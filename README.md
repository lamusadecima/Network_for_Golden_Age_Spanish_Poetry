# Network_for_Golden_Age_Spanish_Poetry

This repository includes complementary materials for my paper "Stylistic Change in Early Modern Spanish Poetry through Network Analysis (with an especial focus on Fernando de Herreraâ€™s role)".

They include:
- The corpus of Early Modern (Renaissance and Baroque) Spanish Poetry used in this study, completed with a file containing metadata information. These are included in the "corpus" folder.

- The R code I wrote for applying several statistical tests to the network. This can be found at the "code" folder.

- Further materials, including the table exported from Gephi and used for the statistical tests and the file that reports the community size distribution, in the "materials" folder.
