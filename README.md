# Network for Golden Age Spanish Poetry

This repository includes complementary materials for my study on a network for Golden Age Spanish Poetry.

They include:
- The corpus of Early Modern (Renaissance and Baroque) Spanish Poetry used in this study, completed with a file containing metadata information. These are included in the "corpus" folder.

- The R code I wrote for applying several statistical tests to the network. This can be found at the "code" folder.

- Further materials, including the table exported from Gephi and used for the statistical tests and the file that reports the community size distribution, in the "materials" folder.

## Corpus

The corpus of Early Modern Spanish Poetry is the one prepared in my PhD: Hernández Lorenzo, L. (2020). <i>Los textos poéticos de Fernando de Herrera: Aproximaciones desde la Estilística de corpus y la Estilometría</i>, supervised by Juan Montero [Universidad de Sevilla]. https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/93465

For the preparation of this corpus, Herrera's and Pacheco's poems were digitalised and modernised by myself. The poems from the rest of the authors were taken from a plain text version of the Corpus of Spanish Golden Age Sonnets, prepared by Borja Navarro and available at his GitHub: https://github.com/bncolorado/CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro . I made some changes on the texts extracted from Navarro's corpus in order to standardise  orthography in all the texts.
